# Statistical-Prgramming
The content is the implemention of the following core algorithms in statistical computing using R, Python and C++.
All the codes avoid the built-in packages and give an insight into the algorithm.

•	Least squares regression, sweep operator, QR decomposition

•	Eigen computation, Principal Component Analysis

•	Logistic regression, Newton-Raphson

•	Lasso, coordinate descent, boosting, solution path

•	Feed-forward neural network, back-propagation

•	EM algorithm, Gaussian mixture, factor analysis

•	Random number generators, Monte Carlo integration

•	Metropolis algorithm, Gibbs sampling, Bayesian posterior sampling
