# Statistical-Prgramming
The content is the implemention of the following core algorithms in statistical computing using R, Python and C++.
All the codes avoid the built-in packages and give an insight into the algorithm.

The topics includes:
1. Least squares regression, sweep operator, QR decomposition
2. Eigen computation, Principal Component Analysis
3. Logistic regression, Newton-Raphson
4. Lasso, coordinate descent, boosting, solution path
5. Feed-forward neural network, back-propagation
6. EM algorithm, Gaussian mixture, factor analysis
7. Random number generators, Monte Carlo integration
8. Metropolis algorithm, Gibbs sampling, Bayesian posterior sampling
